How to work on this?
--------------------

First of all you need Node.js for Grunt and compass. Once you have all that
run following command in your terminal to install Grunt and launch a livereload
server::

    npm install -g grunt-cli
    npm install
    grunt

As long as this is running, all your changes to the .scss files as well as the
index.html trigger a reload of the page in your browser after compass has done
its magic.
